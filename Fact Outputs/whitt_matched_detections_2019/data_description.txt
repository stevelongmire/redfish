Matched to Animals YYYY - These detections have been mapped to animals reported to OTN as having been tagged by your project and can originate from any receiver in the OTN network, including your own (if applicable). This file also includes a data point marking the initial release of each tagged animal that was detected in this year’s file (the receiver column will contain the value RELEASE for these entries).  Please note that we are now matching tags to all OTN-compatible databases worldwide. This may result in biologically improbable matches across large spatial scales. If any detections we have matched to your animals should not be attributed to your animals, please let us know so that we can unmatch these detections. There are OTN developed tools (Python: resonATe (https://gitlab.oceantrack.org/otndc/resonate), R: glatos (https://gitlab.oceantrack.org/GreatLakes/glatos)) which will assist with identifying false detections via impossible velocities. OTN provides support to researchers for the use of these tools. Unmatching detections that you find to be in error will help us match those detections to the correct researcher. Please advise your local node-manager ASAP when you have determined a match to be incorrect.
